- DOM Tree as four main nodes: Document node, Element node, Attribute node, Text node.
- Each node is an object with methods and properties. You use scripts to access and update them.
- Text nodes cannot have children.
- Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves 2 two steps: Locate the node | use its text content, child elements, and attributes.
- DOM queries are methods that find elements in the DOM tree.
- You can store the location of an element in a variable: Known as the selection. 
- Finding the quickest way to access an element within your web page will make the page seem faster and/or more responsive. 
- get El ementByi d () allows you to select a single element node by specifying the value of its id attribute. 
- When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a Nodelist.
- A Nodelist is a collection of element nodes. Each node is given an index number (a number that starts at zero, just like an array). Nodelists looks like arrays but are not and are called collections.
