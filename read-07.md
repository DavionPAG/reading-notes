## Domain Modeling
- "Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem."
- To define the same properties between many objects, you'll want to use a constructor function.
- "new" instantiates an object
- methods can be added to a constructor function's prototype.


## HTML/CSS Chapter 6: Tables

- A table represents information in a grid format. 
- \<table>  used to create a table.
- \<tr>: table row
- \<td>: table data
- \<th>: heading for either a column ora row
- \<thead>: headings 
- \<tbody>: body
- \<tfoot>: footer
- The colspan attribute can be used on a \<th> or \<td> element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across. Example: \<td colspan="3">Name\</td>

## JS Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, and Objects

- The 'new' keyword and the object contructor create a blank object.
- Each statement that adds a property or method should end with a semicolon
- You can use a constructo to create many objects insted of writing them all out.
- The name of a constructor function usually begins with a capital letter
- you can use dot notation to access a property of an object create from a constructor.
- Function in GLOBAL SCOPE: not inside another object or function
- 'this' refers to the containing object
