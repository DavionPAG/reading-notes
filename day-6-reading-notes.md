- when talking about a webpage, you can break it down into three main layers: Content(html), Presentation(css), and Behavior(javascript)
- Javascript adds the interactivity to a webpage.
- it is good practice to keep your javascript in a seperate file as much as possible.

##How Computers Work
- Four task of any computer: Input, Store, Process, and Output
- made up mostly of wires and curcuits
- the bianary number system is at the core of how all computers work. Each position is multiplied by 2 i.e. 1,2,4,8,16.
I now understand what 64 bit refers to :)
Smaller computers are generally faster because the smaller parts means less distance for the electricity to travel which results in faster processing.
