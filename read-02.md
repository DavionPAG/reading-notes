### Comparison Operators: Evaluation Conditions
- '==' : is equal to
- '!=' : is not equal to
- '===' : strict equal to
- '!==' : strict not equal to
- '>' : greater than
- '<' : less than
- '>=' : greater than or equal to
- '<=' : less than or equal
---
### Structuring Comparison operators.
- there is usually one operator and two operands.
- at the most basic level you can evaluate two varibles using a comparison operator to return a true false value.
---
### Logical Operators
- '&&' : Logical **and**
- '||' : Logical **or**
- '!' : Logical **not**
---
### Loops
- Loops check a condition. if it returns *true* then a code block will run. It will continue to check until it returns *false*.
- 'FOR' : if you need to run code for a specific nuimber of times. the condition is usually a counter.
- 'WHILE' : If you are not sure how many times you need the code to run. the condition is something other than a counter. runs as long as the condition is true.
- 'DO WHILE' : simimlar to *WHILE* but will run code at least once even if the condition is false.
### Loop Counter
- 'Initialization' : create a variable and set it to 0. this is commonly call i, and it acts as the counter.
- 'Condition' : the loop should continue to run un the counter reaches a specitic number i.e *i < 10:*
- 'Update' : adds 1 to the counter each time the loop runs the statement in the curly braces.
