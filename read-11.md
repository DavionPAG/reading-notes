## HTML/CSS Chapter 16

- You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS
- Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images
- Two ways to horizontally center an image: text-align(center) | margin(auto)
- The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element.
- The background-attachmentproperty specifies whether a background image should stay in one position or move as the user scrolls up and down the page. It can have one of two values: Fixed or Scroll
- You can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.

## HTML/CSS Chapter 19

- Search engine optimization is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results
- On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines.
- Off-page Techniques: Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. 
- Use keywords in the text that create links between pages (rather than using generic expressions such as "click here").
- Search engines rely on you providing accurate descriptions of images in the alt text.
- !!!Never try to fool search engines! They will penalize you for it. For example, never add text in the same color as the background of the page as they can detect this.!!!
