## DB Normalization

### 14a

- Database normalization: Process used to organize a database into tables and columns
- Limiting table purpose lowers amount of duplicate data
- Reasons to normalize: min duplicate data, avoid modification, and simplify queries
- Problems of Dup. Data: increase storage and decreased performance, difficult to change and maintain
- There are three common forms of database normalization: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal form. They are also abbreviated as 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF respectively.
- First Normal Form: The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
- Second Normal Form: The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the tableâ€™s primary key.
- Third Normal Form: the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
