## JQuery

- JQuery is a JS file you include in your web pages that lets you use CSS-style selectors to find elements and make changes to them.
- $() is the short hand to jQuery()
- It is simpler to use vs using DOM. No need for fallback code. great for event handling. It uses simple selectors and allows you to do common task with less code.
- When you select one or more elements, a jQuery object is 'returned'. Each element returned is given and index.(similar to arrays!)
- You can use jQuery methods to get and set data. USE'html()'
- With jQuery, when a selectorreturns multiple elements, you can update all of them using the one method. There is no need to use a loop.
- You can use more than one jQuery method on the same selection of elements. list more than one method at a time using dot notation to separate each one.
