#SQL

- SQL = Structured Query Language
- Designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.
- SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.
- Some SQL Databases: SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server
- A relational database represents a collection of related (2D) tables.
- To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements
- (*) shorthand to select all columns
- In order to filter certain results from being returned, use a WHERE clause in the query.
- More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous AND or OR logical keywords (ie. num_wheels >= 4 AND doors <= 2). And below are some useful operators that you can use for numerical data (ie. integer or floating point):
- =, !=, < <=, >, >=	Standard numerical operators	col_name != 4
- BETWEEN … AND …	Number is within range of two values (inclusive)	col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5
- NOT BETWEEN … AND …	Number is not within range of two values (inclusive) col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10
- IN (…)	Number exists in a list	col_name IN (2, 4, 6)
- NOT IN (…)	Number does not exist in a list	col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5)
- QL supports a number of useful operators to do things like case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching.
- SQL provides a way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the DISTINCT keyword.
