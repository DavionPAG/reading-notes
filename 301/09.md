## Functional Programming

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
- Pure functions: returns the same result if given the same arguments | does not cause any observable side effects
- Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable. Given the same parameters, pure functions will always return the same result.
- When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.
- if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
- pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
- functions are also treated as values and used as data.
- Higher-order function: takes one or more functions as arguments | returns a function as its result
- Throw errors to spot problems along the way.
- A hash function is used to map a given key to a location in the hash table.
- a function should do one thing.
- Return early from functions:
- Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences:
