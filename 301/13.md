# Sending Form data

- The web is based on a client/server architecture
- An HTML form is simple way to format and http request with user input
- the form defines the data that is to be sent
- action(attr) defines where the data is sent. Must be sent to a relative or absolute URL.
- The method(attr) defines how data is sent.
- The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource:
- a question mark (?) followed by the name/value pairs, each one separated by an ampersand (&).
- if a form is sent using the POST method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.
- When the form is submitted using the POST method, no data is appended to the URL
- The Content-Length header indicates the size of the body,
- Content-Type header indicates the type of resource sent to the server.
- Form data can be seen in the dev tool's network tab.
- Many servers limit the length of URLs they accept.  Some browsers limit URL lenghts
- When sending files: set the method attribute to POST because file content can't be put inside URL parameters.
- Set the value of enctype to multipart/form-data
