#Heroku Deployment

- | sudo snap install heroku --classic |: to install heroku
- System must be up to date with these: node, npm, and git
- | heroku create | prepares Heroku to recieve your app
- When you create an app, a git remote (called heroku) is also created and associated with your local git repository.
- Heroku generates a random name for your app, or you can pass a parameter to specify your own app name.
- heroku ps:scale web=1: test if app is deployed
- Heroku treats logs as streams of time-ordered events aggregated from the output streams of all your app and Heroku components, providing a single channel for all of the events.
